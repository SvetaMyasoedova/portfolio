            <p>7 months ago I could make a site like this using only HTML</p>
            <img className={stylesInfo.project} src={project} alt="My first project" />
            <p>
              But now I can make more complex sites and use different
              technologies

              I have gone through a really exciting journey. And I'm still on
              the road. At the beginning, I could only add a button to a page
              and make it colored. And it was 'wow'.
            </p>
            <p>
              But then JavaScript came to me... and my color button could do
              something else. JavaScript is my first programming language. I
              know it's not perfect. But JavaScript is a really interesting
              language with its pros and cons. I solved more than 150 Ð¡odewars
              tasks to understand this in practice.

              A whisper was heard from behind the door: "your applications should
              be declarative and component-based". It was React. It gave me three
              magic words: 'Create React App'. To understand what to do after
              these three magic words, I decided to take a course. And I
              completed the React Developer Professional Training Course at
              Practicum by Yandex.

              And now I'm here. I am writing this funny mini story and dreaming
              about real team work. I know this story doesn't tell much about
              me, but you can check out my projects and my git. I'm still on the
              road. But I want to grow as a front-end developer and work. I
              would be happy to be part of your team!
